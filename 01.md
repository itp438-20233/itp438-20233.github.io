# Assignment 1 - Unreal Basics

You can't begin this assignment until you've completed the [Setup](https://itp499-20213.github.io/00.html). Because it may take a couple hours to complete the setup, this first assignment intentionally does not have too much work. That being said, you will learn fundamental skills that will be critical for the rest of the semester.

{:.note}
As with all the assignments, make sure to watch the [flipped classroom video](https://itp438-20233.github.io/Weekly.html#wednesday) before starting this assignment.

In this assignment, you will:

1. Configure your Unreal project by setting some recommended options
2. Add a basic HUD class that we'll use to draw a "watermark" on your screen
4. Learn how to use live coding to iterate on your code quickly
