# Basic Dash Setup

We're going to set it up so when you press the Q key, the player quickly dashes forward. This will require adding a new animation montage and some code changes.

## Making a Montage

We don't have a dash animation in the starter animations or the anim starter pack, so instead we're going to take an existing animation and use some frames of it to make it look sort of like a dash.

Under your retargeted animations, right click on `Sprint_Fwd_Rifle_Retargeted` and create a montage. Name it `Dash_Montage`.

If you open up this montage, you'll see one track (called an "Animation Segment") under the DefaultSlot that's named Sprint_Fwd_Rifle. If you click on this you'll see details panel.

What we're going to do is slow down the animation and pick only a subset of the animation to play, it'll look a little silly but since we don't have a real dash animation it's the best we can do.

For the Sprint_Fwd_Rifle segment, set the properties to:

- Start Time to 0.16
- End Time to 0.165
- Play Rate to 0.01

This will play a very small window of the animation over 0.5 seconds, and will look like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/DashMontage.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
## Adding a Binding for Dash

In the project settings, add a new input action mapping for `"Dash"` using the Q key. Then hook up a function in TopDownPlayerController to that mapping.

For now, we just want to get it to play the montage when you press the Q key. Since most of that behavior really is a property of the character, almost all of the code related to dashing will end up there.

In TopDownCharacter add an `EditAnywhere` `UPROPERTY` for a `TObjectPtr<class UAnimMontage>` and call it `DashMontage`. 

Then also add a `StartDash` public member function. For now, the implementation will just tell the AnimInstance that you want to play the montage:

```c++
GetMesh()->GetAnimInstance()->Montage_Play(DashMontage);
```

{: .warn }
The reason we don't just call `PlayAnimation` directly here is it would completely overwrite the animation instance state machine, which we don't want to do.

Now hook up so in your TopDownPlayerController when the Dash action binding happens you call `StartDash` on the character.

*Tip*: You can use the templated version of `GetPawn` to get a pawn of a specific type, so that's the quickest way to get a pointer to the `ATopDownCharacter`

Now back in the editor under TopDown/Blueprints edit the character's DashMontage property so it uses the Dash_Montage asset you created earlier.

If you've set this up correctly, now when you press Q you should see the montage briefly play:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/DashBinding.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Moving Forward

During the dash, we want to ignore other WASD player input and instead just move the player forward in the direction they were facing when they pressed Q.

### Disabling Input During the Dash

To disable input during the dash:

- Add a `UPROPERTY` `bool` that's `Transient` and `BlueprintReadOnly` to the character that tracks if you're in a dash or not, as well as a getter function
- Make it so that `StartDash` does nothing if you're already dashing
- In the player controller, ignore the move forward/move right axes if the character says they're in a dash

Clearly, you can set the bool to true in `StartDash`. But how do you know when the dash is done?

It turns out that by default, `Montage_Play` returns the length of the montage in seconds. So you create an `EndDash` function and use a gameplay timer to trigger it at the correct time.

Test this in PIE. Confirm that if you hold down a movement key and then press Q, you stop moving for about half a second.

### Moving Forward During the Dash

To fake the movement forward during the dash, in the `Tick` of TopDownCharacter  `AddMovementInput` in the *actor's* forward vector with a value of `1.0f`. Just make sure you do this ***before*** the `Super::Tick` call. (Only do this if you're dashing, of course!)

Test this in PIE. Confirm that when you press Q you now move forward in the direction the character was facing. Confirm it works in different directions!

### Moving Forward - Faster!

It would be pretty lame if the dash speed was the same as the normal run speed. So we're going to make it faster.

- Add a `UPROPERTY` `EditAnywhere` `float` called `DashSpeedMultiplier` and default it to `2.0f`
- Similarly add a `DashAccelMultiplier` and default it to `5.0f`
- When you start the dash, you should multiply the `MaxWalkSpeed` on the CMC by your `DashSpeedMultiplier`
- Similarly when you end the dash, divide the `MaxWalkSpeed` by the multiplier
- Do the same for `DashAccelMultiplier`, except you want to change `MaxAcceleration`
- *Hint*: You can use `GetCharacterMovement()` to get the CMC and `MaxWalkSpeed` / `MaxAcceleration` are just public variables

Test this in PIE. You should now move noticeably faster in a dash compared to just your normal running.

## Fixing Interactions with Crouch

There's a couple of weird interactions with crouching. The first is that you can crouch during a dash. The second problem is that if you dash while you're crouching, you end up doing the dash while you're still crouching which isn't fun.

To fix the first problem, add an override of `CanCrouch`. You want to return `false` if you're dashing, and otherwise call the `Super` version (so those conditions still get checked).

To fix the second problem, add code to `StartDash` that says if you're going to dash and are currently crouching (the CMC has a `IsCrouching` function), call `UnCrouch` on the Character.

Test that you've fixed both issues in PIE.

## Making it Look/Sound Cooler

Finally, we'll make the dash look and sound a little cooler using sound and particle animation notifies!

In Dash_Montage, right click on the Notify track "1" at frame 0, and add a "Play Particle Effect" notify that plays `P_Explosion`.

Then, add another Notify track (just click the down arrow to the right of the track). On that track, add a "Play Sound" notify at frame 0 that plays `Explosion`.

{: .note }
We need two notify tracks here because both notifies occur on the same frame, and each track is only allowed to have one notify per frame.

The final version of the dash for this part will look like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/DashPart1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
(Yeah, the particles and sounds don't seem to really fit, but we're making due with our assets!)

Now that the basic dashing is working, we're going to add the basics of damaging the player in [part 2](05-02.html).
