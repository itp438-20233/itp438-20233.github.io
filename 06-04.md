   2. When you die, the game over menu shows up
   3. You can use the mouse to hover over and select different options in the menu
   4. The "Restart Game" button reloads the level and you can move around the character after the restart
   5. The "Quit Game" button will end the PIE session
2. TopDownButton.h/cpp
3. TopDownMenu.h/cpp
4. CombatTextWidget.h/cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. The [basic menu setup](06-01.html#basic-menu-setup) (as in the lecture notes) is complete
2. The [changes to the menu](06-01.html#changes-to-the-menu) are implemented, and both the Restart Game and Quit Game buttons work correctly
3. [Mouse controls](06-02.html) allow you to highlight an option with the mouse and click to activate an option if the mouse is over it
