# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `08` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos which demonstrate that:
   1. You should show your game being played with ***4*** clients
   2. We should be able to tell that the 3rd person mesh is working and the gun follows around
   3. We should see that 2 players are red team and 2 players are blue
   4. You should demonstrate the scoring works properly, being sure to switch between multiple clients to show how they score, and show how it updates the HUD for the score
   5. You should demonstrate that when you run out of ammo, you can't shoot anymore, and then when you pick up an ammo pickup, it adds ammo and you can shoot again 
2. AmmoPickup.h/cpp
3. HUDWidget.h/cpp
4. MultiCharacter.h/cpp
5. MultiGameMode.h/cpp
7. MultiPlayerController.h/cpp
9. MultiProjectile.h/cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. The 3rd person mesh is correctly visible for other (non-local) characters, and the gun follows along and animates correctly
2. Players are correctly assigned to teams, and the red/blue team characters show their team color
3. Score variables are added to the game state and they update correctly when the projectile hits another character
4. The HUDWidget shows the team scores as well as the local player's score correctly
5. Firing uses up ammo, when you run out of ammo you can't shoot anymore, and the current ammo count is displayed on the HUDWidget
6. The AmmoPickup works to give the player more ammo

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
