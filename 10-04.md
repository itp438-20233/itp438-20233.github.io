# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `10` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos which demonstrate that:
   1. Show that when you jump, the jump is reflected in the 3rd person models on the other clients
   2. Demonstrate that when you die, it now shows your death from 3rd person mode, and then starts a 5s countdown timer before you respawn
   3. Demonstrate the chat feature working, show all four clients and show that:
      1. If you send an all chat message from a red player, it goes to all players
      2. If you send a team chat message from a red player, it only is sent to red players
      3. If you send an all chat message from a blue player, it goes to all players
      4. If you send a team chat message from a blue player, it only is sent to blue players
      5. After sending a message, the chat entry is hidden and you can continue playing the game
   4. Show that the countdown timer doesn't start until all players check their ready box, and the if while the timer is running, a player unchecks it, it pauses. Also should show that the ready box disappears when the match starts
2. A screenshot showing the design view of HUDWidget_BP
3. HUDWidget.h/cpp
4. MultiCharacter.h/cpp
5. MultiGameStateBase.h/cpp
6. MultiPlayerController.h/cpp
7. MultiPlayerState.h/cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. 3rd person jump animation works as expected
2. 3rd person death camera, and death respawn timer work as expected
3. Chat messages visually look correct and can minimally be added to the chat messages (even if you can't input them yourself, it's okay if you demonstrate this with hardcoded `AddChatMessage` calls)
4. Chat message text input works (even if it doesn't send messages across the network)
5. Chat message communication works properly across all use cases (team chat and all chat)
6. Ready check is implemented

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
