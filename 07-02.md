# Patrolling

In this part, you'll add logic to the behavior tree that makes the AI patrol when it can't find the player. What we'll do is store an array of actors for the patrol path in the AI character. Then, we'll make a custom behavior tree task that will advance the patrol path to the next actor on the path, which we'll do before using the "Move To" task to move the AI to that actor.

## Setup

First, in the editor, add two new keys to the StealthAI_BB:

- An Int called "PatrolIndex"
- An Object called "PatrolActor" that's set to "Base Class" Actor

Next, add a new C++ class that inherits from `BTTaskNode`. Call it `BTTask_UpdatePatrolPath`.

We want to initialize the PatrolIndex to -1. To do this, in your OnPossess function in your AI controller, after you call UseBlackboard but before you call RunBehaviorTree, add the following line:

```c++
BBComponent->SetValueAsInt("PatrolIndex", -1);
```

You will have to add an include for `"BehaviorTree/BlackboardComponent.h"`.

{: .note }
There are similar `SetValue*` and `GetValue*` functions you can use for all the other key types.

Now in TopDownAICharacter, add the following member variable in the protected section:

```c++
UPROPERTY(EditInstanceOnly, Category = AI)
TArray<TSoftObjectPtr<AActor>> PatrolPath;
```

Add a public getter function that returns the above array by const reference.

## Update Patrol Path

In `UBTTask_UpdatePatrolPath`, you need to add a public constructor and an override of ExecuteTask. Because the task will instantly finish, this simplifies the logic a bit.

The constructor just needs to set the `NodeName` to `"UpdatePatrolPath"`.

For `ExecuteTask`, you need to get the `PatrolIndex` from the blackboard, increment it, and make sure it's wrapped to the patrol path array's valid indices (you can get the path from the AI character). Then you just need to set the `PatrolActor` key to the correct actor (remember you have to use `Get()` to convert a soft object pointer to an actual pointer). When done, just return `EBTNodeResult::Succeeded`.

It's possible that the `PatrolPath` array wasn't setup properly (eg. it's empty), in which case you should return `EBTNodeResult::Failed`.

## Setting the Data

Now in the behavior tree in editor, set it up so if the player isn't set, after the wait for 1s it uses the new update patrol path task, and then it executes a move to the PatrolActor Blackboard key.

Then in the level, place some "Target Point" actors (which already exist) to create a patrol path. You should place at least 4 (though you can put more if you want to). Try to make it so the AI will walk near the area(s) where you have stealth triggers.

To test this, try to hide in your stealth volume by crouching in it. You should see the AI use the patrol paths around you but not come towards you. Then stand up, which will increase your threat level and the AI will see you! This will look like this:
