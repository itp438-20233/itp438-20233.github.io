# Invulnerable Frames

Now let's make it so the player is invulnerable for the first half of the dash. To accomplish this, we'll make an AnimNotifyState subclass that makes the player invulnerable when it begins and vulnerable again when it ends. To better visualize the invulnerability we'll reuse our code to make the player blue and have them turn blue when invulnerable.

## Invulnerable Requestors

Since there are potentially multiple objects which could request invulnerability simultaneously, rather than just using a bool add a `protected` array to TopDownCharacter to track the requestors:

```c++
UPROPERTY(Transient)
TArray<TWeakObjectPtr<UObject>> InvulnerableRequestors;
```

Next,  add public functions to add/remove the requestors (these functions can just take in a raw `UObject*` rather than needing to be the weak object version).

Then make it so that `ShouldTakeDamage` returns false if the number of elements in the array is greater than 0.

{: .note }
The other reason to make this an array of weak object pointers is because then we could check for any orphaned weak pointers in `Tick`, in which case we could remove them. This could happen if, for example, some object forgets to remove itself from an invulnerable requestor before it unloads.

## AnimNotifyState_Invulnerable

In the editor, add a C++ subclass of AnimNotifyState called `AnimNotifyState_Invulnerable`.

In the code, you only need to override `NotifyBegin` and `NotifyEnd`. These just need to call the Add/Remove invulnerable functions you added into the character (and, of course, call the `Super` versions).

_Hint_: `NotifyBegin` and `NotifyEnd` take in the component, so you can get the owner and cast that.

## Adding the Invulnerable to the Montage

Now back in the editor, in the Dash Montage you'll need to add another notify track. This time say "Add Notify State." Set it up so it starts at the beginning and ends between frames 7 and 8 (you can just drag the points).

If you set this up properly, then you should notice that if you stand near the fire you can dash through it to avoid the damage, but if you stand a bit further away and make it so you hit the fire in the second half of the dash, you will take damage. However, this isn't really obvious to the player when they're invulnerable or not, so lets make it a bit more clear.

## Turning Blue when Invulnerable

Make it so when the player becomes invulnerable they turn blue, and then switch back to the normal color when not. You can reuse the linear color variables we'd setup before in an earlier flipped classroom.

Once this is working, you should be able to see the flash of blue when invulnerable, like in the video below. Notice how if the character stand near the fire they can dash through it unscathed, but dashing from too far away still takes damage.

Once this is done, you're ready to [submit](05-04.html).
