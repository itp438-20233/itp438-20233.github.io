# Invulnerable Frames

Now let's make it so the player is invulnerable for the first half of the dash. To accomplish this, we'll make an AnimNotifyState subclass that makes the player invulnerable when it begins and vulnerable again when it ends. To better visualize the invulnerability we'll reuse our code to make the player blue and have them turn blue when invulnerable.

## Invulnerable Requestors

Since there are potentially multiple objects which could request invulnerability simultaneously, rather than just using a bool add a `protected` array of weak pointers to TopDownCharacter to track the requestors:

```c++
UPROPERTY(Transient)
TArray<TWeakObjectPtr<UObject>> InvulnerableRequestors;
```

Next,  add public functions to add/remove the requestors (these functions can just take in a raw `UObject*` rather than needing to be the weak object version).

Then make it so that `ShouldTakeDamage` also returns false if there are any elements in the invulnerable requestors array.

In `Tick`, you should loop over the `InvulnerableRequestors` array *in reverse* (i.e. starting from `InvulnerableRequestors.Num() - 1`) and if `IsValid()` is false on any index, call `RemoveAt` to remove that index.

{:.note}
We are using weak pointers for the array here specifically so we do not control the lifespan of objects which request invulnerability, and our additional loop will remove any orphaned requestors which accidentally forgot to remove themselves before they were destroyed.

## AnimNotifyState_Invulnerable

In the editor, add a C++ subclass of `AnimNotifyState` called `AnimNotifyState_Invulnerable`.

In the code, you only need to override `NotifyBegin` and `NotifyEnd`. You'll want to use the versions declared on lines 64 and 66 of AnimNotifyState.h, and not the deprecated ones. These just need to call their `Super` versions and then call the Add/Remove invulnerable functions on the character, passing in this.

_Hint_: `NotifyBegin` and `NotifyEnd` take in the component, so you can get the owner from the component and cast that to a `ATopDownCharacter`.

## Adding the Invulnerable to the Montage

Now back in the editor, in the Dash Montage you'll need to add another notify track. This time say "Add Notify State." Set it up so it starts at the beginning and ends between frames 7 and 8 (you can just drag the points).

If you set this up properly, then you should notice that if you stand near the fire you can dash through it to avoid the damage, but if you stand a bit further away and make it so you hit the fire in the second half of the dash, you will take damage. However, this isn't really obvious to the player when they're invulnerable or not, so lets make it a bit more clear.

## Turning Blue when Invulnerable

Make it so when the player becomes invulnerable they turn blue, and then switch back to the normal color when not. You can reuse the linear color variables we'd setup before in an earlier flipped classroom.

Once this is working, you should be able to see the flash of blue when invulnerable, like in the video below. Notice how if the character stand near the fire they can dash through it unscathed, but dashing from too far away still takes damage.

Once this is done, you're ready to [submit](05-04.html).
