# Sessions

Now we're going to change the main menu so it creates and joins game sessions through Steam.

## Setting Up the Menu

Update MainMenu_BP so that when you click the "HOST" button it calls the MultiOnlineSystem's `HostSession` function. You can directly access MultiOnlineSystem from any blueprint because it is a Game Instance Subsystem.

Similarly, change the "JOIN" button so it calls `FindAndJoinSession`. Finally, go ahead and remove the IP address text entry as we don't need it if we're using Steam.

Now create a package. The buttons won't do anything just yet, but we'll work on it.

{: .note }
You won't need to change any content for the rest of Part 2, so you can iterate to test it without making a new package (at least on the machine you're building on, which for now do that on the machine you intend to be the host). Consult the lecture notes to see how to iterate on standalone without making a package. 

## Creating a Session

We want the `HostSession` function to start the flow of creating the session.

First, in MultiOnlineSystem.cpp add an include for `"OnlineSessionSettings.h"`.

Now you need to create the server session and respond to it (you'll want to keep the lecture notes handy):

1. In `HostSession`, use `SessionInterface->CreateSession` and all the parameters will be exactly like in the slides

2. In the delegate for `OnCreateSessionComplete`, if `bWasSuccessful` is true, call `SessionInterface->StartSession`

3. In the delegate for `OnStartSessionComplete`, add the following code to open the level:
   ```C++
   UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel(GetWorld(), "FirstPersonMap", true, "listen");
   ```

Now it's time to test. First make sure that you have Steam running and are logged into an account. When you run your standalone game, if you click the "Host" button you should see that the game loads into the map after a second or so.

I would also suggest looking at the Output in Visual Studio to confirm that you see output like this (you'll have to scroll up a little bit):

This is just information about the named session which was created.

{: .note }
If you're running from a package, the log file will output to `Multi/Saved/Logs`. You'll see the most recent log and previous ones, and can view them in any text editor. 

## Joining a Session

Now you need to setup the code to join via Steam. Again, the lecture notes show the exact examples of the code you'll need.

1. In `UMultiOnlineSystem::Initialize`, when you get the `FriendsInterface` you should call ReadFriendsList to get the `"inGameAndSessionPlayers"`. Don't worry about the delegate for now.
2. In `FindAndJoinSession`, get the friends list and call `FindFriendSession`
3. In the `OnFindFriendSessionComplete` handler, you need to `JoinSession`
4. In the `OnJoinSessionComplete` handler, you need to `GetResolvedConnectString` and then `ClientTravel`

To test this, first make sure both Machine A and Machine B are logged into Steam with different Steam accounts, and are friends with each other

{:.note}
If you made a second Steam account to test this, keep in mind that new Steam accounts cannot send friend requests for some time period. However, your existing Steam account should be able to send a friend request to the new one.

Next, do the following:

1. On Machine A (your Paperspace VM), launch the game standalone and select "Host"
2. On Machine B, launch the game from the package and select "Join"
3. Machine B should join the game, and then when you check the ready button on both machines, the game should launch and you should confirm that both machines are in the same game and playing against each other.

{: .warn }
Because we're currently only reading the friends list to find in game and session players on initialization of MultiOnlineSystem, that means for now, if you launch your game before anyone is hosting, you won't be able to join any game. We'll fix this in the last part of the assignment.

If everything works as expected, it should look something like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/11-2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Once you've confirmed that one player is able to host on Steam and their friend is able to join the game, you're ready to move on to [part 3](11-03.html).
