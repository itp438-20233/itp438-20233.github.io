# Assignment 2 - Puzzles


{:.warn}
Don't begin this assignment until you've gone through the Week 2 flipped classroom video, as you'll be using the TriggerBoxPlayer_BP we made in that video.

In this assignment, you will:

1. Change the controls so the player moves with WASD instead of click to move, and can jump with the space bar
2. Create a component used for puzzles called `UPuzzleComponent`
3. Implement multiple puzzles which utilize `UPuzzleComponent`
