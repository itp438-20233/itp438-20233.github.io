# Seeing the Player

In this part, you'll improve the vision detection of the AI so it takes into account line of sight, and so that it also accounts for the player's current threat level.

## Distance/Angle Check

Rather than the FindPlayer service always seeing the player wherever they are, we'll change it so that there's both a distance and an angle in front of the AI character. The required angle and distance is based on the stealth "threat level" of the player (that you implemented for the midterm).

| Threat | Magnitude of Angle | Distance |
| :----: | :----------------: | :------: |
| Green  |        0.52        |   100    |
|  Blue  |        0.70        |   250    |
| Yellow |        0.87        |   500    |
|  Red   |        1.22        |   2000   |
| Purple |        1.57        |   4000   |

Keep in mind the angle is the absolute value of the angle (eg. so what you get when you dot product and take acos).

For example, if the player's threat level is Red, the player has to be within 2000 units and 1.22 radians for FindPlayer to find them. If either of those conditions are not satisfied, FindPlayer should set the `PlayerKey` back to `nullptr`.

*Hint*: `OwnerComp` has a `GetAIOwner()` function that returns a pointer to the `AAIController`. You can get the character given the controller.

## Line Trace Check

In order for the AI character to not block the `ECC_Camera` channel, you also need to go into the AI character blueprint, and change the "Collision Preset" to "Custom." Then change the response to "Camera" traces to "Ignore." You will need to do this twice -- both for the mesh and for the capsule component (since thy both respond to traces).

If both the distance and angle checks succeed, the next step is to use `LineTraceSingleByChannel` on the `ECC_Camera` channel. You want the trace to be from the AI character's position to the player's position. If the Hit Result's `GetActor` matches the player character actor, that means there's nothing blocking the camera between the AI and the player.

*Hint*: You can access this function from the world, so like: `GetWorld()->LineTraceSingleByChannel(...)`

*Hint 2*: You should not need to change either `Params` or `ResponseParam` for this to work.

Next, you need to set it so that in the Behavior Tree the "Blackboard Based Condition" decorator for "Player is Set" on both branches has the "Observer aborts" property set to "Self." This is what causes the sequence and any children to halt if the FindPlayer service changes the value of the Player key such that the decorator condition is no longer true.

If this all works as expected, you should be able to lose the AI by placing a pillar between you and the AI. Furthermore, if you get the AI far enough away from you and they're chasing you while running, if you enter into a stealth trigger and go to prone, which will turn your threat level to green, the AI will stop chasing you. This will look something like this:

Now it's time to move on to [part 2](07-02.html).
