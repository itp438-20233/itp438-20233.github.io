# The Final Puzzle

Now it's time to put together the different techniques together to create a final puzzle, which will look something like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/FinalPuzzle.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

You are not required to make your puzzle look exactly like this, but you are required to meet the following minimum criteria:

- There needs to be *at least* 3 pressure plates which are on the ground floor, and they're hooked up to lights that are red when the plate is inactive and green when they're active
- At least one crate must require an additional puzzle piece and a Level Sequence to "unlock" it -- in the sample, I used an additional pressure plate to raise lower the platform which allows me to get the second crate
- Once all 3 pressure plates are activated (so their lights are green), it should release a `Fireball_BP` which should automatically roll in some manner. It should eventually light up a `TorchFire_BP`
- When the `TorchFire_BP` is activated, it should open the final door

Again, this is just the *minimum criteria* needed to meet the specification. If you'd like to be more creative and make your puzzle more [complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine), go for it!

## New Blueprints

You should already have blueprints for almost everything that's needed, but there's two new ones you'll need to make to meet the minimum criteria:

- You'll need a new kind of Puzzle Light that's always on, but is red if the input is `false` and green if the input is `true`. This Puzzle Light should also set its own output as well, so it can be in a chain (eg. pressure plate -> this puzzle light -> ??)
- You'll need to make a new puzzle piece that plays a sequence *once*, the first time it's activated, and then never again

## Assets Used

Here are some of the assets I used. You aren't required to use them, but if you're curious, these are the ones I used:

- Under StarterContent/Architecture there's different size walls, some with doors
- I used the `M_Glass` material on some walls to make them partially transparent
- The ramp was a `Shape_Wedge_B`
- For the door, I used `SM_DoorFrame` and `SM_Door`

## Hints

Here are some hints that might be helpful when implementing this puzzle:

- Don't forget you need to use "Keep State" to get actors to keep their state when a sequence ends
- You may need to wake up the fireball so it rolls after being at rest for a while
- You can add multiple actor tracks into a sequence, if needed
- To prevent an actor's position from changing due to a sequence, you can remove the "Transform" section for that actor

Once this is done, you're ready to [submit](04-04.html).
