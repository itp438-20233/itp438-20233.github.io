# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `07` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos which demonstrate that:
   1. Show that you can lose the AI when it's chasing you by hiding behind the pillars (like in the video for part 1)
   2. Show that you can hide out in stealth and the AI won't see you as they patrol near you, but then if you stand up they will see you (like in the video for part 2)
2. A screenshot showing your completed behavior tree
3. TopDownAICharacter.h/cpp
4. TopDownAIController.h/cpp
5. BTTask_UpdatePatrolPath.h/cpp
6. BTTask_FindPlayer.h/cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. The distance/angle checks work properly based on the threat level
2. The line trace makes sure that the enemy has line of sight to acquire the player
3. The `UpdatePatrolPath` code is implemented to specification
4. Patrolling works correctly for the AI, including the modifications to the behavior tree

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
