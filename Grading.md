# Grading

Flipped classrooms/labs are graded Credit (CR)/No Credit (NC).

Exams are graded on a points scale from 0 to 100.

programming assignments are graded using a specification-based grading system. You can receive one of four grades: A, B, C, or F, which corresponds to:

* A - All specifications are met, there are no significant errors or bugs, and the code quality meets or exceed code review expectations
* B - All specifications are met but there are bugs and/or code quality issues to address
* C - Not all specifications are met, but at least 50% of them are
* F - Less than 50% of the specifications are met.

Students will receive their initial grade for each assignment with a list of requirements that should be satisfied in order to improve their grade. Students will have up to four days to make a regrade submission, upon which their assignment will be regraded. The grade can improve up to one letter grade (eg. B can improve to A, C can improve to B, and F can improve to C). The purpose of this grading system is to become comfortable with the standard software engineering industry practice of code reviews, as well as to allow room to learn from mistakes.

As an example, here is the criteria to receive an A in the course:

* Get Credit (CR) on at least 9/12 flipped classrooms
* Get a B or higher on all 12 programming assignments (the final grade after your regrade)
* Get an A on at least 8/12 programming assignments (the final grade after your regrade)
* Have an average exam grade of at least 85%

Note that to receive a particular grade you must satisfy ***all*** listed criteria. Furthermore, there is no spill over or bonus points across the criteria. For example, if you have an exam grade of 90%, that doesn't mean you need less Bs or As on assignments to get an A in the course.
