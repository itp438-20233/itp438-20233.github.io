# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `09` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos which demonstrate that:
   1. Show the green "STARTING MATCH" alert when the game starts
   2. Show that when one team reaches 10 points, it shows that the team wins, and then it reloads the game. Remember, for this to work properly, you have to test on Standalone.
   3. Show that when enemies die, they play a death animation and their collision doesn't block you when dead
   4. Show that the enemies respawn after 5 seconds, and that they won't spawn right in front of you if you try to spawn camp
   5. Demonstrate the kill streaks up to "GODLIKE" as well as an opponent ending a spree
2. HUDWidget.h/cpp
3. MultiCharacter.h/cpp
4. MultiGameMode.h/cpp
5. MultiGameStateBase.h/cpp
6. MultiPlayerController.h/cpp
7. MultiPlayerState.h/cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. Basic alert messages are implemented and the "STARTING MATCH" message works
2. End of match logic works including showing who won and reloading the level
3. Basic death logic, death animations (both 1st and 3rd person), and preventing collision works
4. Players respawn after 5 seconds when they die
5. Preventing spawn camping is implemented as specified
6. Kill streak message alerts display on screen, as well as the end of streak message

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
