# Setup

The assignment setup process will take approximately 5 hours to complete, although the majority of that time will be waiting for steps to finish:
1. [Connecting to Your VM](00-01.html)
2. [Setting up Perforce](00-02.html)
3. [Running Unreal](00-03.html)
4. [Committing to Perforce](00-04.html)

## (Optional) Also Setup Your Local Machine

Once you've completed the setup steps you can also [*optionally* setup your local machine for development](00-05.html), assuming that your machine is capable of running Unreal 5. If you'd like to run locally, the bare minimum specs are roughly:

- Windows 10/11 (although the editor does run on Mac and Linux as well, I don't recommend it)
- 8-core CPU
- 32 GB of system RAM
- Nvidia GTX 1080 or AMD RX Vega 64 w/ 8GB of VRAM (if you want to use hardware raytracing, you need more)
- 250+ GB free space on an SSD

If your machine does not meet these specs, it's strongly recommended you do your assignments on your VM.

Even if you are going to use your local machine for development, you *still* need to do all the previous setup steps first, as your local machine will sync to the Perforce server that is setup on your VM.
