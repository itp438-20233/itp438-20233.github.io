# Improvements

In this last part, you're going to improve the saving / loading and also hook up starting a new/clean save in the main menu.

## Autosave

Instead of just saving every time a tag is added to the ground truth save data, change it so MultiGameMode will instead request a save every five seconds while the match is in progress (you could use a gameplay timer for this).

Then, to account for if the match ends in between autosaves, also save when the match ends. Finally, just to be safe also save in end play.

## Async Save

Add a bool flag to your MultiSaveSystem function to be able to save asynchronously (using `AsyncSaveGameToSlot`) instead of synchronously. You should use the async save for the auto save, but use the sync save when the match ends or when end play occurs.

## Save Indicator

Many games will show some visual indicator while the game is saving in the background. Add a "Circular Throbber" element in the bottom right corner of the HUDWidget. Then, make it so that when you start an async save it shows the throbber and *0.25 seconds after the async save finishes*, hide it. You need that delay because otherwise you'll have a hard time seeing the throbber as our saves finish too quickly!

{: .warn }
Although we're just testing in listen server mode now, so it is guaranteed that the server will have a local player controller, ideally you'd make this logic robust enough so it wouldn't crash on the dedicated server!

## Main Menu Changes

For this last portion, you will have to test everything works using the two machines and Steam approach again, since you won't be able to test the main menu flow and hosting/joining works properly otherwise.

Change it so instead of one "HOST" button, there are two:

- HOST (CONTINUE)
- HOST (NEW GAME)

The "continue" option should behave just like the previous host button did.

The "new game" option, though, will need to write out a blank save. You'll need a MultiSaveSystem function that does this (eg. make a `NewObject`, make that the ground truth, and then save that synchronously). There's no "delete save" function so the simplest is to just make an empty one. After you do that you'll still need to call `HostSession` so the game will start.

Then, in the code for the main menu, in `NativeConstruct`, make it so that the "continue game" option is only displayed if you already have a save file, otherwise it should be collapsed. You'll need to add a MultiSaveSystem function which tells you whether or not there's a save file.

Then, make your package and test it on your two machines. Assuming you initially start with no save data on the server, it'll look like this:



<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/12-3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


{: .note }
Since new game just will write an empty save file, the "continue" will keep showing up after you host once, unless you manually delete the save file from the package (in Multi/Saved/SaveGames)

Once this is complete, it's time to [submit](12-04.html)!
