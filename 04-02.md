# Fire Component

We're going to create a component that can spread fire between objects. The basic idea is that the Fire Component will track whether the object is on fire or not. It will have a sphere collision that doesn't block other objects, but instead generates overlap events. If an "on fire" FireComponent overlaps with another FireComponent, it will spread the fire.

## Declaring UFireComponent

In the editor, add a new C++ Class called `FireComponent`. You'll want to inherit from `SphereComponent` (under "All Classes").

When you inherit from an uncommon class, the generated code will have no automatically-added functions or `UCLASS` specifiers.

First, we need to change the `UCLASS` specifier to this so that we can add the component in the editor:

```c++
UCLASS(ClassGroup=(Custom), meta=(BlueprintSpawnableComponent))
```

Next, add a public declaration of the constructor and a protected override of `BeginPlay`, adding stub implementations in the .cpp for both.

- Make sure `BeginPlay` calls the `Super` version
- The constructor should set `PrimaryComponentTick.bCanEverTick = false;`

{:.danger}
If you don't call `Super::BeginPlay` in the fire component BeginPlay, the component will not work properly at all.

## Hooking into OnComponentBeginOverlap

The inheritance hierarchy for `UFireComponent` is pretty deep:

`UFireComponent` -> `USphereComponent` -> `UShapeComponent` -> `UPrimitiveComponent` -> `USceneComponent` -> `UActorComponent`

At the `UPrimitiveComponent` level, there's the following delegate:

```c++
UPROPERTY(BlueprintAssignable, Category="Collision")
FComponentBeginOverlapSignature OnComponentBeginOverlap;
```

We want to register to this delegate, but to do that we need to figure out the appropriate signature of the function.

If you go to line 234 in `PrimitiveComponent.h`, you'll see the declaration of the signature. Ignore this part:

```c++
 FComponentBeginOverlapSignature, UPrimitiveComponent, OnComponentBeginOverlap
```

Everything after that corresponds to the required signature for your function. The only gotcha is that there are extra commas between each type and parameter name, so you'll have to remove those.

Copy those parameters and then declare a `UFUNCTION` in `UFireComponent` called `HandleOnBeginOverlap` that returns `void` and has those parameters. Add a stub implementation of the function.

Then, in `BeginPlay`, register your function with the delegate, which should simply just be:

```c++
OnComponentBeginOverlap.AddDynamic(this, &UFireComponent::HandleOnBeginOverlap);
```

If it doesn't compile it likely means your `HandleOnBeginOverlap` signature is incorrect.

## Clearing OnComponentBeginOverlap

It's a good practice to always add matching calls to clear any bound delegates in `EndPlay`. To do this:

1. Add an override of `EndPlay` (remember, this takes in a parameter, so it's easiest just to copy the declaration from ActorComponent.h and add `override`)

2. In your implementation, first call `Super::EndPlay`

3. Next use the following code to unbind `this` from `OnComponentBeginOverlap`:

   ```c++
   OnComponentBeginOverlap.RemoveAll(this);
   ```

## Adding Fire Spreading

Now add the code/variables to track whether the fire component is on fire or not. If an on fire one overlaps with another actor which has a fire component that's not on fire, it should spread the fire. 

Remember you can use `FindComponentByClass` on the `OtherActor` to get its `UFireComponent` (if it has one).

Keep in mind that:

- The designers will want to be able to control whether or not an object starts out on fire
- You should add a blueprint assignable delegate for when the fire component "catches on fire" (it doesn't need any parameters). This is so we can later drive puzzle behavior based on whether something is on fire or not
- You should follow the same pattern as before where there's a "Native" Catch Fire function that sets any properties broadcasts the delegate
- You should call the native catch fire in `BeginPlay` if the object is starting out on fire

*Hint*: Don't worry about the visual effect of being "on fire" yet. We'll add that once we confirm the fire is "spreading."

## Fireball_BP

We're going to make a rolling ball to test out the behavior of FireComponent. Then we'll place two in the level -- one will start on fire and the other will not. We'll test that when they overlap with each other, it'll spread the fire.

Create a new Blueprint that inherits from StaticMeshActor. Set the mesh to be `Shape_Sphere`. Set the material to `M_Concerte_Poured`. Turn on Simulate Physics and set the Mass to 500 so it's a bit heavier. We don't want any constraints here as we want it to roll.

Now add a FireComponent as a child of the static mesh. You'll want to position it so it's at the center of the sphere (which should be z=50). Set the sphere radius to 60, which will be a little larger than the sphere itself. This is intentional because if it were the same size as the sphere, a collision between spheres may not generate the overlap event.

Now place two fireballs in the level. Make one be on fire at level start, and the other not. Roll the on fire one to the not-on-fire one, and verify with a breakpoint that the fire "spreads."

## Adding Particle and Sound Effects

Now we'll make it so the fireball actually has a fire particle and sound effect.

In Fire Component, add two `EditAnywhere` `UPROPERTY`s that are `TObjectPtr`s -- one to a `USoundBase` and one to a `UParticleSystem`.

Then in your Native catch fire function, use the following gameplay statics functions to play sounds/emitters:

- `UGameplayStatics::SpawnSoundAttached`
- `UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAttached`

Now in the `Fireball_BP`, set the sound to `Fire01` and the effect to `P_Fire`.

If the fire spreading and effects work, it will look and sound something like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/Fireballs.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Flaming Swing

Make it so the ball on the swing can also catch on fire, and test that you can roll a flame ball to it to set the swing's ball on fire.

## TorchFire_BP

Now we're going to make a new puzzle piece that can catch on fire, and when it does, it sets its output active.

Make a new blueprint subclass of StaticMeshActor, call it `TorchFire_BP`. For the static mesh use `SM_Lamp_Wall`, then add the fire and puzzle components. Set it up so that when it catches fire it also sets its puzzle output to true.

Now setup two of these torches lined up so you have to spin the swing from before in order to spread the fire from the swing to the two torches (you may have to experiment with the placement a bit to get it to line up properly). Then make the two torches route to a PuzzleAND that routes to a PuzzleLight.

Add text on the ground that says "Spin".

You want the puzzle to work something like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/FireSpin.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
{:.note}
If you're having difficulty making a puzzle like this work, you may want to increase the radii of the fire components on the swing ball and/or TorchFire_BP.

To cap things off, you'll put together the different techniques you've learned to create a [final puzzle](04-03.html)!
