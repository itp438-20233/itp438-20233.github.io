# Adding More Puzzles

For this final part, there are no detailed instructions. Instead, you need to implement them using what you've learned so far!

## PuzzleOR

This first one isn't too crazy. Make a `PuzzleOR_BP` which activates as long as any of the inputs are true. This should generically work on any number of elements, not just necessarily two.

Then, place some switches and a light in your level (separate from the others) that demonstrates the PuzzleOR working. Add a TextRenderActor nearby that says "OR".

*Hint*: The easiest way to do this is to duplicate `PuzzleAND_BP` and you just need to make a slight modification to its Blueprint logic.

## SequencePuzzle

This one is a bit more complicated.

You need to make a puzzle in `SequencePuzzle_BP` that requires that you activate puzzle inputs in a specific order.

The SequencePuzzle needs to verify that all puzzle inputs become true in the expected order. If the inputs come out of order, SequencePuzzle should call `PuzzleReset` on each puzzle element that's part of the sequence. This will reset all the puzzle elements back to their false state. (Similarly, if the SequencePuzzle receives an input of false, it should reset).

*Hint*: Think about how you'd do this with an array in C++. You can do the same thing with an array in Blueprint. Remember is a "For Each" loop you can use on arrays in blueprint.

*Hint 2*: In Blueprint, remember you have to resolve soft object references to the actual actor. Then, you can use "Get Component by Class" to get a component of a specific type from an Actor.

{: .danger}
If you try to compare a Actor Soft Object Reference to an Actor, it will crash the engine when trying to compile the Blueprint. You need to first "Resolve" the Soft Object Reference.

Only once the sequence is completed in the correct order, SequencePuzzle will set its output to true.

To demonstrate this functionality, add a puzzle with three switches that have GlowColors of red, white, in blue. These switches should not be disabled when the player steps off them. The correct order to press the switches is red, then white, then blue. Once the player completes the sequence properly, activate a light near the puzzle.

*Hint*: To get the floor switches to reset their `GlowColor` if the SequencePuzzle calls `PuzzleReset`, you will have to add a handler to the "On Puzzle Reset" delegate in `PuzzleFloorSwitch_BP`.

SequencePuzzle should generically work on any number of elements in a sequence. It should not be hard-coded to only work with a sequence of size three.

Finally, add a TextRenderActor nearby that says "Sequence".

{: .note}
It's expected that if you step on the blue or white switch before stepping on the red one, no switch will light up as the puzzles will instantly reset.

Once you've completed both PuzzleOr and SequencePuzzle, you're ready to [submit](02-04.html).
