# Ammo Pickups

In this part, you'll add ammo tracking and ammo pickups.

## Tracking Ammo

Right now, you can fire infinitely however much you want to, but we want to change this.

Add a replicated property to `AMultiCharacter` to track the ammo. By default, characters should start with 5 ammo. Every time the server is told to fire, it will fire if there is ammo left and decrement the ammo by one. Once the player has no ammo left, the server should not allow the player to shoot anymore (and it shouldn't play the animation or sound, either). Add text to the HUD which shows how much ammo the player has left.

*Hint*: Keep in mind that the server should be authority on how much ammo the player has left, and the client should simply just show this value (replicated). Also don't forget to update `GetLifetimeReplicatedProps`.

*Hint 2*: Since the server is authority, it should validate that the player has ammo left before firing.

If this works properly, it'll look something like this:

## Picking Up More Ammo

Add a new C++ actor subclass called `AmmoPickup`:

- It should replicate
- It needs two components: a `USphereComponent` and `UTextRenderComponent`
- Its root component should be a `USphereComponent` with a sphere radius of 25.0f
- The `UTextRenderComponent` should be attached to the root with the Text set to `"Ammo"`, have a vertical/horizonal alignment of center, and has a green text render color
- It should have a `UPROPERTY` that designers can edit to set the amount of ammo it gives (defaults to 5)
- In `BeginPlay`, bind to the SphereComponent's `OnComponentBeginOverlap` delegate (you may want to look how you did this in `UFireComponent`). However, ***only*** bind this delegate for `ROLE_Authority`, which means only the server will respond to collisions (and they will be ignored on the clients)
- In the delegate, if a character overlaps with the pickup, you should add the ammo to the character and destroy the ammo pickup

Then in the editor, create a blueprint for the ammo pickup. In general, it's a good practice to make a blueprint of any actor you want to place in the level, so that designers can tweak it later if needed.

Manually place several instances of the pickup blueprint in the level and test it out! If it works, it should look something like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/08-03-2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Now it's time to [submit](08-04.html).
