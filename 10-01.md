# Improvements

In this part, you're going to improve several smaller things with the game.

## Fixing 3rd Person Jump

We're going to fix the 3rd person jump by using the three jump animations we had in TopDown. To do this, you'll need to reopen TopDown in Visual Studio or Rider and launch it. In the Content Drawer, go to Characters>Mannequins>Animations>Manny. Select these three animations:

- MM_Fall_Loop
- MM_Jump
- MM_Land

Then right click and say Retarget Anim Assets>Duplicate Anim Assets and Retarget:

* For the IK Retargeter, select RG_UE5Manny_UE4Manny (as this retargets the animations to the older mannequin)
* Set the folder to /Game/AnimStarterPack
* Save the animations

Now in the content drawer under AnimStarterPack, select these three MM animations and save them. Then right click and say Asset Actions>Migrate. When the dialog comes up saying which assets you're going to migrate, uncheck the UE4_Mannequin and Characters folders, so it will only migrate the three animations. Then, click OK and browse to the Multi/Content folder as the destination.

Then, close TopDown.

If you then go under the AnimStarterPack folder in Multi, you should see the three MM animations you migrated. They will not be in Perforce, though, so you need to mark them for add. (You can right click and select Revision Control>Mark for Add in the Content Drawer).

If you open one of the MM animations, you'll get an error about a missing skeleton and whether you want to choose a new one. Say "Yes" and select UE4_Mannequin_Skeleton. It'll open and should look correct, and then save the animation. You'll need to repeat this for all three MM animations you migrated.

For MM_Land specifically, you also need to go into the "Asset Details" and change the "Additive Anim Type" to "No additive". Otherwise, it won't work properly.

Now, change the UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint so that the jump uses the three animations that transition correctly based on whether you're jumping or not. To do this:

* In the anim graph, delete the existing Jump and Run Jump States
* Add 3 different states: Start Jump, Jump Loop, End Jump. They need to each play the animations we just retargetted. Remember Start Jump needs to transition from both Idle and Jog, and End Jump transitions back to only Idle
* Delete the existing "Jump" nodes in the event graph as you don't need them anymore
* Get rid of the "Enable Jump" and "Is Jumping" variable
* Add a new "Is Falling" variable that is updated in Event Blueprint Update Animation from whether the character is falling or not
* Hook up the transitions for the 3 jump states you added. Remember you'll want to transition to "Start Jump" if "Is Falling" is true and then transition out of "Jump Loop" if "Is Falling" is false. For the other transitions, you can use "Time Remaining (ratio)"

Once this is setup, you should be able to see the third person model use the jumping animation:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/10-01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


{: .note }
Notice how in the jumping animation, the player's arms go to the side so the gun goes there as well. If we wanted to keep the upper body animations the same but only change the lower body animations, it would be possible However, this requires more work. You can look at "[Using Layered Animations](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/using-layered-animations-in-unreal-engine/)" in the documentation for further information.

## 3rd Person Death Camera

Rather than showing your death in first-person, we'll change it to use a 3rd person camera instead when you die.

First, in MultiCharacter you'll need to add an additional `UCameraComponent` called `ThirdPersonCameraComponent`. When you create it in the constructor:

- Attach it to Mesh3P
- Set `bUsePawnControlRotation` to `false`
- Set `bAutoActive` to `false`
- Set the relative location to `(0.f, -400.f, 350.f)`
- Set the relative rotation to `(-45.f, 90.f, 0.f)`

Then when you are about to play the death animation on a client, you should check if the character `IsLocallyControlled()`, in which case you need to:

- `SetOwnerNoSee(true)` on the first-person mesh and gun (for the gun, you'll have to get the `USkeletalMeshComponent` from the `WeaponActor`)
- `SetOwnerNoSee(false)` on the third-person mesh and gun models
- Deactivate the first person camera component
- Activate your 3rd-person camera component

Keep in mind this is only changing everything for the local client, but that's fine. The server doesn't need to be involved to handle this.

If this works properly, it should look like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/10-01-2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
{:.note}
If the dying player is too close to one of the walls, you may see the wall instead of the character. We could fix this by adding camera collision, but we'll not worry about that.

## Death Respawn Timer

Finally, we want to make it so when you die, the local client shows both a message that you're dead as well as a 5 second countdown timer. For this timer, you can completely manage it locally -- the server doesn't have to be involved.

{: .warn }
Handling the respawn timer on the client separately like this only works since the respawn timer is a fixed amount of time. We know it's always 5 seconds so we can just fake showing the timer on the client completely independent of the server. However, if the timer could vary -- for example every time you die, the timer gets longer, the server would have to tell us what the correct timer is.

Confirm that when you die now, you see a death message as well as a timer, like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/10-01-3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Now it's time to add text chat in [part 2](10-02.html).
