## Description and Assessment of Assignments 

Most flipped classroom activities will involve some amount of coding work which, depending on the activity, may involve working under the direction of the instructor, working individually, or working in small groups. This is to reinforce and expand on concepts from the lecture and required reading for that week.

The programming assignments will be individual assignments that expand on the materials covered in class meetings, and students should expect to spend 8-10 hours/week working on the assignments and flipped classroom materials.
