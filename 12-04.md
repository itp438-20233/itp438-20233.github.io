# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `12` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos which demonstrate that:
   1. You can press 1-5 to switch tags, and spray paint the different tags (can just show this in PIE)
   2. Demonstrate that the basic saving and loading works (can just show this in PIE)
   2. We should be able to see the save indicator every 5 seconds with the async save (can just show this in PIE)
   4. Demonstrate that the main menu works properly (show this in standalone over Steam):
      1. When you have no save, only "New Game" shows up
      2. When you do have a save, "Continue" shows up as well, and if you pick it you'll load into the game with your tags from the save
      3. When you do have a save, "New Game" will overwrite your save with a blank one, so you won't see the older tags anymore
2. TagActor.h/cpp
2. MultiSaveGame.h/cpp
2. MultiSaveSystem.h/cpp
2. MultiPlayerController.h/cpp
2. MultiGameMode.h/cpp
2. HUDWidget.h/cpp
3. MainMenuWidget.h/cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. The 1-5 keys change the tags you spray paint, and you also see the current tag icon in the HUD
1. MultiSaveSystem save/load implementation works for the tags (basically everything in [part 2](12-02.html))
1. Autosave is implemented and you can see the autosave indicator
1. The main menu changes with new game/continue work as expected

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
