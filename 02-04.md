For this assignment, put your files in the `02` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos that demonstrate the following (make sure you still have the watermark):
   1. Show the WASD movement and the spacebar to jump.
   2. Clearly demonstrate the functionality of the puzzle areas (along with the text actors) for Original, AND, OR and Sequence. Don't just immediately solve every puzzle. Make it clear that the switches that should reset when you step off do reset, and fail the sequence puzzle at least once. 

2. TopDownPlayerController.h
3. TopDownPlayerController.cpp
4. PuzzleComponent.h
5. PuzzleComponent.cpp
6. A screenshot of your Blueprint Script for "On Receive Input" in your PuzzleAND blueprint
7. A screenshot of your Blueprint Script for "On Receive Input" in your PuzzleOR blueprint
8. A screenshot of your Blueprint Script for "On Receive Input" in your PuzzleSequence blueprint

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. Movement is switched over to WASD and all remnants/old code from click to move have been excised
2. PuzzleComponent with functions/properties implemented as specified
3. Your "Original" switch puzzle should work as specified in the instructions
4. Your "AND" switch puzzle should work as specified in the instructions
5. Your "OR" switch puzzle should work as specified in the instructions
