# Assignment 5 - Dashing and Damage

Don't begin this assignment until you've gone through the Week 5 flipped classroom video, as you'll need to be familiar with the animation content covered in it.

In this assignment, you will:

1. Setup an animation montage and basic functionality for a forward dash move
2. Add basics of player health/damage as well as dying, and testing it with a pain causing volume
3. Make the player invulnerable during the first half of the dash
