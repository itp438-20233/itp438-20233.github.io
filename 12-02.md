# Save / Load Basics

Now it's time to setup saving and loading of the tags so that when the server launches again it can reload any saved tags.

You will need to create two new C++ subclasses: one of `SaveGame` called `MultiSaveGame` and one of `GameInstanceSubsystem` called `MultiSaveSystem`.

## MultiSaveGame

In MultiSaveGame.h, add the `USTRUCT` as specified in the lecture slides. You'll want to put it before the `UCLASS` declaration of `UMultiSaveGame`.

Then, you can add a `UPROPERTY` `TArray` of the struct type into `UMultiSaveGame`.

## MultiSaveSystem

There's quite a bit to do in here, so let's break it down.

### Ground Truth UMultiSaveGame

The MultiSaveSystem needs to retain a `UPROPERTY` `TObjectPtr` to the "ground truth" version of the `UMultiSaveGame` object.

We can't just try to load the game when the subsystem initializes as it's gonna happen at the very start of the game loading and we don't know whether we're going to be a server or client yet. And even if we are going to be a server, we don't know for sure that the save file will exist when it's time to load.

So, instead what you should do is just use `NewObject` to make an empty/default `UMultiSaveGame` in `Initialize`. That way there will always be an available object, if needed, regardless of the existence of the save file.

### Updating the Ground Truth Save

Next, you need to change it so that whenever the server adds a tag, it also adds a corresponding `FTagActorSaveData` to the ground truth save owned by `MultiSaveSystem`.

### Saving the Ground Truth Save

Add a function to the `MultiSaveSystem` to save the game. For now, just use the `UGameplayStatics` function to just do a basic (sync) save. Just use `"SaveGame"` as the slot name.

For now, hook it up so every time you add an additional `FTagActorSaveData` entry you also call the save system's `SaveGame`.

If you run in PIE, try placing a couple of tags. You can verify the save is written by looking in the `UnrealEngine/Multi/Saved` directory. You should have a `SaveGames` directory and in there, a `SaveGame.sav` file. This means you're writing some save game, at least.

### Loading the Game

Now add a function to `MultiSaveSystem` that loads the game using the sync load function. `LoadGameFromSlot` will return nullptr if the save file wasn't found, so if it's null you will need to make a `NewObject` and set your ground truth pointer to that.

If the load succeeded, you should change the ground truth pointer to the new one you got. Then, you should spawn all the tag actors specified in the save data you just loaded, and manually call `SetActorRotation` and `SetActorScale3D` on each tag actor as you spawn it (this is because the tag actor/decal actor messes with the rotation/scale when it's spawned).

Next, in MultiGameMode you need to add an override for `HandleMatchIsWaitingToStart`. In there, you should call the save system function to load the save.

If this works, when you load the game in PIE you should notice that the tags from your previous save are there. You can test a "fresh" save for now by just deleting that `SaveGame.sav` file. Ultimately, you should observe behavior like this (starting with no existing save):

Once you've verified the save / loading is working, it's time to move on to [part 3](12-03.html).
