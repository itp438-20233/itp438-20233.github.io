# Damage

Unreal has some built-in support for actors receiving damage through the [TakeDamage](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AActor/TakeDamage/) function. And you can even define different [types of damage](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/UDamageType/) so you could make it that some characters are resistant or vulnerable to certain types of damage. Although this built-in support for damage won't work for every type of game, for many games it is enough. An added bonus of using Unreal's built-in damage system is there are some support classes that you can use such as [PainCausingVolume](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/APainCausingVolume/).

## Adding Health to the Character

To track health, we'll just add two `UPROPERTY` `float`s to TopDownCharacter. One is an `EditDefaultsOnly` called `MaxHealth` (initialize it to `100.0f`), and the other is a `Transient`/`BlueprintReadOnly` called `CurrentHealth`.

Then you just need to set the `CurrentHealth` to `MaxHealth` in `BeginPlay` (you'll have to add an override).

## Showing Health in the HUD

Add a text display to your TopDownHUD which just outputs the current health of the player character. You can use `UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerCharacter` to get the player character. Keep in mind it may be null.

You want to show the health as an integer (you can use `FMath::RoundToInt`). You can use the `FString::Printf` function to create an `FString` using a printf-style syntax.

You should then have a text display that looks something like this:

## Fire Pain Causing Volume

Now let's do some damage to the player. The [PainCausingVolume](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/APainCausingVolume/) can trigger damage on the player. However, because of the way this works using a `BrushComponent`, you can't actually make a blueprint out of it (which is pretty annoying).

Instead, you can place a `PainCausingVolume` in the level using the "Create" menu under Volumes. Place one in the level. Change it's "Damage Per Sec" to 10.

Next, drag some `P_Fire` particles from StarterContent/Particles where the volume is so you can easily see in game where the fire is. I needed four particle effects to denote the bounds of the volume well.

To make it so the character actually takes damage, you should override the `TakeDamage` function in `TopDownCharacter`. Because the function returns the amount of damage done, you should first call the Super version and save what it returns. Then, if the damage the `Super` function returned is non-zero, you should subtract that from the current health. Then make sure you still return the result from the Super call!

If you set this up properly, walking into the fire should reduce your health by 10, and standing in the fire will repeatedly reduce it by 10 more every second:

## Death

Right now the player's health will hit 0 and they can still keep playing as their health goes more and more negative. Let's make it so the player dies when their health hits 0.

### Triggering Death Montage

To do this, we need a couple more variables in TopDownCharacter:

- A bool to track whether or not the player is dead
- Montage for the death animation montage

Then in `TakeDamage`, when the player's health goes less than or equal to 0, set the death bool to true and play the montage.

Back in the editor, pick your favorite death animation in the retargeted AnimStarterPack and make a montage out of it (doesn't need anything special in it, just has to be a montage). Then hook this up in your character.

Now in PIE, confirm that the character starts playing the death montage when they die. But if you stay in the fire they'll keep taking damage and restart the montage over and over again. We'll fix that next.

### Preventing Further Damage Once Dead

We're going to block further damage events from occurring if you're dead. To do this, override `ShouldTakeDamage` (it comes from Pawn). Your override should return false if you're dead, or else just return what the `Super` returns.

Now when you die, you should stop taking more damage. However, once the montage finishes the player gets back up and can still move during the death montage and afterwards!

### Preventing Further Movement Once Dead

The simplest way to stop any further movement is to disable input, so you won't be able to move, jump, dash, etc., anymore.

To do this, call these functions when the character dies:

```c++
// Get this pawn's controller as a APlayerController
APlayerController* PC = GetController<APlayerController>();
// Call disable input on the controller (it's silly, but you have to pass in itself)
PC->DisableInput(PC);
```

Now when you die, you shouldn't be able to move any further. You still will pop back up at the end of the death montage, though.

### Pausing All Animations

The easiest way to pause all animations is to call `Deactivate()` on the skeletal mesh component.

So, just add a new member function to `ATopDownCharacter`, and when you die setup a gameplay timer to trigger `0.25f` seconds before the montage ends. In that function, call `Deactivate` on the skeletal mesh component. (You can't trigger it right when the montage ends as it'll already be blending back into the AnimGraph state machine).

Now when you die, it should stay in the death animation:

  <source src="assets/Death.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

In the last part, we'll make it so the [dash makes you temporarily invulnerable](05-03.html).
