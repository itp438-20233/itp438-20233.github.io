# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `04` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos which demonstrate that:
   1. The flaming swing "spin" puzzle correctly spreads fire and spins the swing. Specifically, you should have to roll a fireball to the swing to set it's ball on fire, and then you should demonstrate spinning the swing with the pressure plate and using the character to push the swing to set the two torches on fire, at which point the light nearby should turn on
   2. You should demonstrate the full solution of your final puzzle. Please clearly demonstrate that the lights toggle between red and green as appropriate, based on the player (or crates) using the pressure plates. It must be clear that your final puzzle meets all the minimum required criteria.
2. FireComponent.h
3. FireComponent.cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. The basic Swing_BP works (irrespective of the fire effect), and you can spin it using a pressure plate and a sequence
2. The FireComponent can spread fire between two objects (including particle effect/sound)
3. The flaming swing "Spin" puzzle is implemented, including working FireTorch_BPs
4. The two new blueprints needed to support the final puzzle are implemented
5. The final puzzle is implemented and meets the minimum criteria listed

_Note_: Since there are 5 spec items, you have to implement at least 3 to get a C grade.

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
