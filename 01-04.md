# Submission Requirements

As mentioned in lecture, we will not be syncing to everyone's Perforce. Instead, you will need to submit a video as well as some supporting files to the Google Drive that's shared with you.

For this assignment, put your files in the `01` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. Your video - It should demonstrate that you can move around the character with click-to-move and that the watermark properly shows on screen
2. DefaultGame.ini
3. DefaultEngine.ini
4. TopDownHUD.h
5. TopDownHUD.cpp
6. TopDown.uproject
7. Your .clang-format file

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. DefaultGame.ini and DefaultEngine.ini are configured as per the assignment instructions (these automatically will get modified if you made the required changes), and you have a `.clang-format` file.
2. Implemented the `TopDownHUD` class which overrides `DrawHUD` to draw your watermark.

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
