# Mouse Support

In this part, you'll add mouse support to the menu. The player should be able to select menu options by highlighting them with the mouse, and left click will activate the current menu option the mouse is hovering over (if the mouse is currently hovering over an option).

This should only require editing TopDownMenu.h/cpp, you shouldn't need to change any other source files or any of the blueprints.

This is actually not very much code at all, so I'm not going to tell you what to do exactly, but I'll give some hints:

- You'll want to override two functions from the parent class
- `FPointerEvent` has a way to get the screen space position from
- Given an arbitrary `UWidget`, you can use `GetCachedGeometry` to get the bounding extents/transform of the widget (as an `FGeometry`)
- `FGeometry` has a very handy `IsUnderLocation` member function

If this is implement properly, the player should be able to move the mouse to select options, and then left click on an option if one is highlighted. (Notably, if the mouse isn't anywhere near an option, the left click shouldn't do anything).

If this works properly, it will look something like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/MouseControl.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

In the last part, you'll add "floating" [combat text](06-03.html).
