# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `05` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos which demonstrate that:
   1. The dash works in all directions, and it works whether moving or stationary when you start
   2. If you stand in the fire, your health ticks down to zero and you die with a death animation (and stay in the dead pose)
   3. Demonstrate that you can dash through the fire without taking damage if it's in the first part of the dash (in blue), but if you dash from further away you still take damage
2. A screenshot of your Dash_Montage opened in the montage editor
3. TopDownCharacter.h/cpp
4. AnimNotifyState_Invulnerable.h/cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. The [Basic Dash Setup](05-01.html) is complete
2. The player has health, which is displayed on the HUD, and takes damage when standing in the pain causing volume
3. The Death animation/other Death logic all works as expected
4. AnimNotifyState_Invulnerable is implemented, and the player becomes invulnerable (and turns blue) for the first part of the dash

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
