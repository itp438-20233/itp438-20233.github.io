# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `03` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. One or more videos that demonstrate the following (make sure you still have the watermark):
   1. The interact glow and hint
   2. The improved best candidate selection works (specifically, something isn't selected if too far away, and if the player isn't facing something it's not selected)
   3. Demonstrate the `TimedTorchInteract_BP`
   4. Toggle on/off the debug visualization console command
   5. The PuzzleRotate functionality working as in the demonstration GIF
   
2. PuzzleRotate.h/cpp
3. InteractSubsystem.h/cpp
4. InteractComponent.h/cpp
5. TopDownHUD.cpp
6. PuzzleComponent.cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. Interact glow and hint are implemented
2. Improved best candidate selection only allows you to pick interact objects that are close enough and in front of the player
3. Enabling/disabling interact is implemented and `TimedTorchInteract_BP` works
4. `APuzzleRotate` code is setup as expected (this spec doesn't require the implementation of `OnRotateTimer`)
5. `APuzzleRotate::OnRotateTimer` works to rotate between multiple `InputActors`
7. Improved debug visualization and console command is implemented

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/).
