# Kill Streaks

For this last part, you'll add kill streak tracking and send alerts out when a spree is in progress.

You can store the spree progress as an integer in MultiPlayerState. It doesn't need to replicate as only the server will be tracking the streaks for now. Then when a player scores a kill, it should add 1 to their current streak. If a player dies, their streak progress should reset.

When a player reaches a kill streak threshold, the server should send out an alert according to the table below. So for example after 3 kills they'd get the killing spree alert, but they wouldn't get another alert unless they reached 5.

The alert should be in the color of the team the player is on, and last for 2.5 seconds. You can get the player's name from the PlayerState with `GetPlayerName()`.

| Streak | Alert                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 3      | _PlayerName_ is on a killing spree! |
| 5      | _PlayerName_ is dominating!         |
| 7      | _PlayerName_ is UNSTOPPABLE!        |
| 9      | _PlayerName_ is GODLIKE!            |

If a player who had a streak 3 or higher dies, then the server should announce that their streak has ended with "_KillerPlayerName_ ended _DeadPlayerName_'s streak!"

Once someone's streak ends, if they reach the kill streak thresholds in the table again, the server would send out the messages again.

In a real game, we'd want to make the streak messages and everything configurable and localizable. But for this assignment you don't have to worry about that, and you can just add the messages in code.

This will look something like this when implemented (the announcer sound effects are extra -- you aren't required to implement them for the assignment):

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/09-03.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

{: .note }
You may notice the default player names for me were quite long, as it defaults to your machine name plus an identifier. One trick you can do is setup the alert text block in UMG so that it's center aligned and anchored to the width of the screen. Then you can enable "Auto Wrap Text" so that it will word wrap if the text is too long.

## For Fun - Announcer Sound Effects

You aren't required to implement the announcer sound effects meet the specification requirements. But if you'd like to implement them, here are the sounds I used:

<audio controls src="assets/killingspree.wav"></audio>

<audio controls src="assets/dominating.wav"></audio>

<audio controls src="assets/unstoppable.wav"></audio>

<audio controls src="assets/godlike.wav"></audio>

You can import these assets into the editor. Then, to reference the sounds in code, you can make `AMultiPlayerState` have a`UPROPERTY` map for the different sounds. Then make a `MultiPlayerState_BP`  which sets the sounds as appropriate, and in `MultiGameMode_BP` change the "Player State Class" to point to the BP instead.

In any event, it's time to [submit](09-04.html)!
